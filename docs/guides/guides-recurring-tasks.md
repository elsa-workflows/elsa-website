title: Create & run a recurring workflow 
sidebar_label: Recurring Tasks
---

In this guide, we will do the following:

* Create a console project.
* Programmatically define a workflow using the Workflow Builder API that automatically executes every 5 seconds using the `Timer` activity.
* Convert the project into an ASP.NET Core project and create the same workflow using the visual designer.

## Create Console Project

Create a new .NET Core Console project called `ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks`:

```bash
dotnet new console -n "ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks"
```

CD into the created project folder:

```bash
cd ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks
```

And add the following packages:

```bash 
dotnet add package Elsa
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Temporal.Quartz
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
```

## The Recurring Workflow

Create a new file called `RecurringTaskWorkflow.cs` and add the following code:

```csharp
using Elsa.Activities.Console;
using Elsa.Activities.Temporal;
using Elsa.Builders;
using NodaTime;

namespace ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks
{
    public class RecurringTaskWorkflow : IWorkflow
    {
        private readonly IClock _clock;

        public RecurringTaskWorkflow(IClock clock) => _clock = clock;

        public void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder) =>
            builder
                .Timer(Duration.FromSeconds(5))
                .WriteLine(() => $"It's now {_clock.GetCurrentInstant()}. Let's do this thing!");
    }
}
```

## Program

Now that we have a workflow, we need to be able to execute it. Since the workflow starts with the `Timer` activity, Elsa can invoke it for us if we setup a .NET Host. Let's see how that works.

Open `Program.cs` and replace its contents with the following:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Elsa;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main()
        {
            var host = new HostBuilder()
                .ConfigureServices(ConfigureServices)
                .UseConsoleLifetime()
                .Build();

            using (host)
            {
                await host.StartAsync();
                await host.WaitForShutdownAsync();
            }
        }

        private static void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) =>
            services
                .AddElsa(elsa => elsa
                    .AddConsoleActivities()
                    .AddQuartzTemporalActivities()
                    .AddWorkflow<RecurringTaskWorkflow>());
    }
}
```

> Notice that we don't have to invoke the workflow ourselves manually. Instead, this is taken care of by a background task that is executed within the host built with `HostBuilder`.

## First Run

Run the program. After 5 seconds, you will start seeing the following output:

```text
It's now 2021-05-08T11:24:06Z. Let's do this thing!
It's now 2021-05-08T11:24:11Z. Let's do this thing!
It's now 2021-05-08T11:24:16Z. Let's do this thing!
```

That's all it takes to setup a .NET application that is capable of executing recurring workflows.

> **The Real World**
>
> In real-world scenarios, you might want to configure a persistence provider so that workflow instances get persisted.

## Visual Workflows

Now that we've seen how to create a recurring workflow using Elsa's Workflow Builder API, let's see how we can convert the project into an ASP.NET Core host that is capable of the following things:

* Host the Elsa Dashboard.
* Host the Elsa Server API Endpoints (for consumption by the Elsa Dashboard).

We'll use the dashboard to visually create the same workflow.

### Convert Project

Open the `ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks.csproj` file and replace its contents with the following:

```xml

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Elsa" Version="2.0.0-rc1.27"/>
        <PackageReference Include="Elsa.Activities.Temporal.Quartz" Version="2.0.0-rc1.27"/>
        <PackageReference Include="Elsa.Designer.Components.Web" Version="2.0.0-rc1.27"/>
        <PackageReference Include="Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Sqlite" Version="2.0.0-rc1.27"/>
        <PackageReference Include="Elsa.Server.Api" Version="2.0.0-rc1.27"/>
    </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Create a new file called `Startup.cs` and replace its default contents with the following:

```c#
using Elsa;
using Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Core.Extensions;
using Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Sqlite;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddRazorPages();
            
            services
                .AddElsa(options => options
                    .UseEntityFrameworkPersistence(ef => ef.UseSqlite())
                    .AddConsoleActivities()
                    .AddQuartzTemporalActivities()
                );

            services
                .AddElsaApiEndpoints();
        }
        
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            app.UseStaticFiles();
            app.UseRouting();
            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapControllers();
                endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Update `Program.cs` with the following contents:

```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

namespace ElsaGuides.RecurringTasks
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args) => CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();

        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder => webBuilder
                    .UseStaticWebAssets() // See note "Blank Page?!".
                    .UseStartup<Startup>());
    }
}
```

Finally, create a new folder called `Pages` and add a new file called `_Host.cshtml` with the following contents:

```html
@page "/"
@{
    var serverUrl = $"{Request.Scheme}://{Request.Host}";
}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <title>Elsa Workflows</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/assets/images/favicon-32x32.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/assets/images/favicon-16x16.png">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/assets/styles/tailwind.css">
    <script src="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/monaco-editor/min/vs/loader.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/elsa-workflows-studio.esm.js"></script>
</head>
<body class="h-screen" style="background-size: 30px 30px; background-image: url(/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/assets/images/tile.png); background-color: #FBFBFB;">
<elsa-studio-root server-url="@serverUrl" monaco-lib-path="_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/monaco-editor/min"></elsa-studio-root>
</body>
</html>
```

## Second Run

When you now run the project, you should see the Elsa Dashboard homepage and be able to create new workflows.

> **Blank Page?!**
>
> When I first followed my own guide, the page was simply blank when I launched the application.
> As it turns out, due to the fact that I converted the project from a console app to a web app myself, I didn't get the launchSettings.json file in the Properties folder that is created when using the web project template.
> This means that by default, the application will run in **Production** mode and not in **Development** mode.
> According to [the Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/ui-class?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio), assets from Razor Class Libraries (such as `Elsa.Designer.Components.Web`) will only be served in **Development** mode or when the application is published.
> From the docs:
>
> "When running the consuming app from build output (dotnet run), static web assets are enabled by default in the Development environment. To support assets in other environments when running from build output, call UseStaticWebAssets on the host builder in Program.cs".
>
> For this reason, I included the `UseStaticWebAssets` call in `Program.cs` to make sure this guide works smoothly.

## Visual Workflow

Let's go ahead and navigate to the **Workflow Definitions** page and click the **Create Workflow** button.

Add a new `Timer` activity by clicking the **Start** button (reload the page [if you don't see any Start button](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/issues/915)). Since the `Timer` activity uses NodaTime's `Duration` type to store
the interval, we can provide the following text value to specify an interval of 5 seconds:

```text
00:00:00:05
```

Instead of using a plain text value, we might also take advantage of using a JavaScript expression and directly employ NodaTime's `Duration` type to construct an interval, like this:

```javascript
Duration.FromSeconds(5)
```

To switch to JavaScript mode, click on the small button with an icon representing horizontal triple dots and select "JavaScript":

![Switching to JavaScript mode](assets/guides/guides-recurring-tasks-animation-1.gif)

Click the **Done** outcome's "plus" button to create & connect a new `WriteLine` activity and configure it as follows:

* Text (JavaScript): `` `It's now ${new Date()}. Let's do this thing!` ``

Click **Save** and then click **Publish** (at the bottom right of the screen).

Elsa will now re-index the published workflows and see that there's a workflow with a `Timer` activity. Every 5 seconds, something like the following string will be written to standard out:

```bash
It's now Sat May 08 2021 12:50:34 GMTZ. Let's do this thing!
```

And that's how easy it is to setup an Elsa Dashboard + Server and create some workflows!
