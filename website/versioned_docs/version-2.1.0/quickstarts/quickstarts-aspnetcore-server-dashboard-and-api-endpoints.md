title: ASP.NET Core Server with Elsa Dashboard + Elsa Server API Endpoints
sidebar_label: Elsa Dashboard + Server
original_id: quickstarts-aspnetcore-server-dashboard-and-api-endpoints
---

In this quickstart, we will take a look at a minimum ASP.NET Core application that hosts both the Elsa Dashboard component as well as the Elsa Server API endpoints.

We will:

* Create an ASP.NET Core application.
* Configure a persistence provider with EF Core and the SQLite provider.
* Register various activities for use in workflows.
* Expose the Elsa API Endpoints for consumption by external applications (including the Elsa Dashboard).
* Install the Elsa Dashboard component.
* Create a simple workflow using the designer.

## The Project

Create a new, empty ASP.NET Core project called `ElsaQuickstarts.Server.DashboardAndServer`:

```bash
dotnet new web -n "ElsaQuickstarts.Server.DashboardAndServer"
```

CD into the created project folder:

```bash
cd ElsaQuickstarts.Server.DashboardAndServer
```

Add the following packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Http
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Temporal.Quartz
dotnet add package Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Sqlite
dotnet add package Elsa.Server.Api
dotnet add package Elsa.Designer.Components.Web
```

## Startup

Open `Startup.cs` and replace its contents with the following:

```csharp
using Elsa;
using Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Core.Extensions;
using Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.Sqlite;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

namespace ElsaQuickstarts.Server.DashboardAndServer
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IWebHostEnvironment environment, IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Environment = environment;
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        private IWebHostEnvironment Environment { get; }
        private IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            var elsaSection = Configuration.GetSection("Elsa");

            // Elsa services.
            services
                .AddElsa(elsa => elsa
                    .UseEntityFrameworkPersistence(ef => ef.UseSqlite())
                    .AddConsoleActivities()
                    .AddHttpActivities(elsaSection.GetSection("Server").Bind)
                    .AddQuartzTemporalActivities()
                    .AddWorkflowsFrom<Startup>()
                );

            // Elsa API endpoints.
            services.AddElsaApiEndpoints();

            // For Dashboard.
            services.AddRazorPages();
        }

        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            if (Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }

            app
                .UseStaticFiles() // For Dashboard.
                .UseHttpActivities()
                .UseRouting()
                .UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
                {
                    // Elsa API Endpoints are implemented as regular ASP.NET Core API controllers.
                    endpoints.MapControllers();
                    
                    // For Dashboard.
                    endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
                });
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that we're accessing a configuration section called `"Elsa"`. We then use this section to retrieve sub-sections called `"Server"`.
Let's update `appsettings.json` with these sections next:

## Appsettings.json

Open `appsettings.json` and add the following section:

```json
{
  "Elsa": {
    "Server": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:5001"
    }
  }
}
```

> The reason we are setting a "base URL" is because the HTTP activities library provides an absolute URL provider that can be used by activities and workflow expressions.
Since this absolute URL provider can be used outside the context of an actual HTTP request (for instance, when a timer event occurs), we cannot rely on e.g. `IHttpContextAccessor`, since there won't be any HTTP context.

## _Host.cshtml

Notice that the application will always serve the _Host.cshtml page, which we will create next.

1. Create a new folder called `Pages`.
2. Inside `Pages`, create a new file called `_Host.cshtml`.

Add the following content to `_Host.cshtml`:

```html
@page "/"
@{
    var serverUrl = $"{Request.Scheme}://{Request.Host}";
}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <title>Elsa Workflows</title>

    <script type="module" src="/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/elsa-workflows-studio.esm.js"></script>
</head>
<body class="h-screen" style="background-size: 30px 30px; background-image: url(/_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/elsa-workflows-studio/assets/images/tile.png); background-color: #FBFBFB;">
<elsa-studio-root server-url="@serverUrl" monaco-lib-path="_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/monaco-editor/min"></elsa-studio-root>
</body>
</html>
```

## Run

Run the program and open a web browser to the home page:

![](assets/installation/installing-elsa-dashboard-figure-1.png)

Because we configured the <elsa-studio-root> element with a valid URL to a running Elsa server (which is the same application hosting the dashboard), we can click around the menu.
Let's create a workflow next.

## The Workflow

Navigate to the **Workflow Definitions** page and click the **Create Workflow** button.
We are now on the workflow designer canvas. Click the green **Start** button to open the **Activity Picker** and search for the **HTTP Endpoint** activity and select it.

The next screen presents the available settings for the activity. Specify the following values:

- Path: `/hello-world`
- Methods: `GET`

And click the **Save** button.

We are now back in the designer which shows the HTTP Endpoint activity we just added. The activity has a single outcome called **Done**. Click on the **plus** button below it to add and connect another activity to this outcome.
The activity picker shows up again. This time, search for the **HTTP Response** activity and select it.

The next screen presents the available settings for the activity. Specify the following values:

- Status Code: `OK`
- Content: `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`
- Content Type: `text/html`

And click the **Save** button.

Finally, let's give our workflow a name. From the designer, you'll find a cog-wheel button at the top-right of the screen. Click it to open the workflow settings and provide the following values:

- Name: **HelloWorld**
- Display Name: **Hello World**

Leave the rest to their defaults and click the **Save** button.

Back on the designer, click the **Publish** button on the bottom-right of the screen.
The workflow is now published and ready to be invoked!

We'll try out the workflow in a second. Here's an animation that shows the above steps:

![Elsa Workflows Hello World demo with HTTP activities](assets/quickstarts/quickstarts-aspnetcore-server-dashboard-and-api-endpoints-animation-1.gif)

> **Bug Alert**
> 
> There's currently a small issue with the designer where sometimes it doesn't initially render the nodes correctly (which causes the Start node to be invisible for example).
> Until that issue is resolved, simply refresh the web page (press F5). The workflow should now render properly.

## Execute Workflow

Since the workflow starts with an HTTP Endpoint activity configured to listen for HTTP GET requests at `/hello-world`, we can open a new web browser tab and navigate to `https://localhost:5001/hello-world`.

## Next Steps

You are now well on your way to mastering Elsa Workflows!
We've seen how to setup an ASP.NET Core project that hosts both the Elsa Dashboard as well as the Elsa Server API Endpoints.

Next steps will be to learn more about the various activities available to you, how to configure them with workflow expressions, and how to develop your own activities.
